## 0.1.1

Small Improve:

* Small Refactories
* Change the "self" property to "this", so when the "this" be used, it will refer to the class itself.

## 0.1.0

Basic features:

* Create classes using an intializer (the constructor)
* The class creation proccess raises an exception if the constructor is defined and is'nt a function.
* A class should be created without the initializer.
* All things that are declared within the "self" block will be adds to the self class, like the self variable in the Ruby language.
* All things that are declared outside the "self" block will be for the class instances.
